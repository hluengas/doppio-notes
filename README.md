# Doppio Notes

Some notes on caring for Doppio

## Emergencies

If any accidents or medical issues come up please utilize any vet or animal urgent care that might be necessary. We will certainly reimburse you for any expenses. Doppio has medical insurance but it does not need to be billed for the treatment; they will reimburse us. Please save any invoices/receipts.

## Food / Supplements

Doppio is a grazer. He eats (or doesn't) when he feels like it, and typically won't eat all his food in one sitting. Sometimes he won't eat anything on a given day. He'll usually just be hungrier the next day. If he goes multiple days without eating there may be an issue.

## Health

As noted in the previous section doppio has some allergies that manifest as little scabs on his skin. Mostly on his belly and chest. The vet told us there is not much we can do to treat them other than experiment with diet changes or treat the allergies with an antihistamine. They are a bit itchy for him, which can be an issue if he scratches off the scabs creating open wounds. If you notice he is itching a lot or if you notice open scabs on him please treat the skin with wipes/spray that we will provide. The product is called Dechra "MiconaHex+ Triz" it is a antibacterial/antifungal topical that comes as a spray and in presoaked wipes. You can use whichever is more convenient.

Another thing to look out for is ear infections. The skin in his ears is normally white. If you notice his ear skin is pink or red or he is itching his ears a lot he probably has one. This can be treated with the same Dechra wipes. **Do NOT use the Dechra spray in or around his ears.** The medicine has bad side affects if it gets into the inner ear. If he gets an ear infection just rub the Dechra wipes around the skin of his outer ear. Don't push the wipes deep into the ear or squeeze the liquid out so that it drips deep into his ear.

He takes heart worm and tick medicine (Simparica Trio) monthly, he has already had his October dose.

## Doggie Business

He can hold it for awhile, and is well house trained. He likes to go out when everyone wakes up, and when he determines people are going to bed. At home he has a bell hanging from the backdoor that he knows to ring when he wants to go outside. We will provide a bell if you want to use this system. Without a bell he will whine or bark by the door. Without the bell he may also scratch at your door, so we'd recommend the bell.

In new places he sometimes tries to mark. Watch out for this for the first few days. Scold him vigorously if caught. Apologies in advance if this happens. If he poops and is not being supervised, he will likely eat the poop. We've tried hard to correct this, but it is what it is at this point. If you don't want that happening, we'd suggest not letting him roam outside unsupervised. If it doesn't bother you, then it should not hurt him or be a major health concern according to out vet. To stop him, simply tell him "leave it" after he poops.

## Night Time

We'll bring a crate for doppio and a few dog beds. Doppio will sleep in the crate we bring (or any dog bed really). He normally sleeps in the bed with us, but is perfectly fine sleeping on the ground. If you want him to sleep in your bed that is fine, but he needs to be picked up every time or use his ramp. No jumping!

## Ramps / Jumping

Please vigorously scold doppio if he does any jumping. No jumping on furniture. No jumping on people's legs. He follows these rules very well already. He never jumps on furniture and only occasionally on people, but please enforce this. We will bring our bed ramp if you want to use it. He also has a smaller couch ramp that we can bring if desired. He also has accidentally been trained not sit on the couch unless there is a blanket he can sit on. We'll bring a few if you want to allow him on the couch. If you don't want him on the couch that is fine he will happily sit near the couch in a dog bed.

## Walks / Other Dogs

Doppio likely won't let you take him for a walk, at least for a while. He may go for a block or two, then he will refuse to go any further. He likes walks, but we think he is fearful that we will return for him and he won't be there. He'll be more likely to accept exploring and playing in the backyard.

Doppio is not very good with other dogs unfortunately. He loves other weenie dogs and he is pretty friendly with small dogs (equal or lesser size to him), but he can be quite aggressive with any dogs larger than himself. He especially hates doodle mixes or other high energy attentive breeds. We would recommend not letting him interact with medium/large dogs at all. That includes my brother's dogs. Please do not let my brother take him or bring his dogs over; they do not get along.

## Toys

We'll bring a selection of toys to leave with Doppio. He mostly likes chewing on hard and soft toys. He will destroy them piece by piece. That is fine and expected. For the most part he will just spit out the destroyed pieces as he progresses. Sorry if he makes a mess. Sometimes he gets threads or stuffing stuck in his mouth/teeth; please help him remove these if you notice this. He also like fetch/chase, but he may not do this until he develops some trust. He also might not play much at all. Especially for the first few days, he might be too sad/anxious.
